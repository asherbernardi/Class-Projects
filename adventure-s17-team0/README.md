Story
-----

*slam* goes the door, *clank* go the keys, *click* goes the lock, *TAP Tap tap*
fade the footsteps.  Huh.  Well.  In retrospect, you begin to suspect that your
host was being somewhat less than truthful when he remarked, "Oh look, it says
'gullible' inside that dark, musty, and definitely completely safe stairwell!"

No use questioning it now, you've just got to find your way out.  You try
another door, locked.  Another?  Locked.  Whoever really lives here must be
paranoid, about everything here is locked: drawers, cupboards, jewelry boxes,
even the iPad on the desk (hey, it was worth a shot).  What's more, it is
clear that each one would require a very different key.  As you sink to the
floor in resignation, your hand lands on something small and metal that you
couldn’t see in the dark.  You pick it up and... could this small brass key be
the first step in your escape?  You figure you’ll need to unlock everything in
the house just to get out the front door...

... oh no, is that smoke you smell??  Better hurry, this place might be going
up in flames!
